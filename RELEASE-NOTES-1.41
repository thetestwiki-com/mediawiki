== MediaWiki 1.41.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.41 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.41 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.41 upgrades are below:
* (T178356) MediaWiki now requires browsers to support ES6 for them to receive
  JavaScript, up from ES5. In practice, this primarily means that users of
  Internet Explorer 11 (EOL in 2022) will no longer get JavaScript tools.
* …

For notes on 1.40.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.41 ===
* …

==== New configuration ====
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgAuthManagerAutoConfig – When using this setting to modify the
  authentication system in MediaWiki, the classes
  TemporaryPasswordPrimaryAuthenticationProvider,
  LocalPasswordPrimaryAuthenticationProvider and
  EmailNotificationSecondaryAuthenticationProvider now require
  DBLoadBalancerFactory, not DBLoadBalancer, as a service.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgCommentTempTableSchemaMigrationStage – This temporary flag did let you
  control the migration stage for the temporary comment database table, from
  revision.
* …

=== New developer features in 1.41 ===
* Added ForeignResourcesDir extension.json / skin.json attribute, which should
  point to the directory holding your foreign-resources.yaml file. See
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Foreign_resources for background.
* Added a .gitmessage commit template. To use it, run:
  `git config commit.template .gitmessage`
* A new hook, TextSlotDiffRendererTablePrefixHook, has been added to allow
  extensions to add content within #mw-content-text but after the
  DifferenceEngineViewHeader or DifferenceEngineShowDiffPage hooks have been
  run. The new hook is used to add elements within a horizontal display area,
  where their order can be explicitly set. Examples of uses for this include
  adding the VisualEditor diff-type switch, and the legend for inline diffs that
  is displayed if Wikidiff2 is installed.

* ExternalLinksLookup::getExternalLinksForPage() now exists to centralize
  logic of looking up externallinks rows.
* The update script no longer accepts the --skip-compat-checks option.

   - The return value of User::getRequest()

  stable to extend, and adding type hints to parameters is backwards
  compatible. Therefore, this is not considered a breaking change.

  supporting extension registration (using extension.json or skin.json).
  It will no longer attempt to load PHP entry points.
